Data structure is the study of various ways of organizing data in a computer.
This data is manipulated by a systematic and step-by-step process called Algorithm.
This Manipulation involves various techniques like adding, searching, deleting, rearranging, sorting and Traversing
These data structures are used by Operating systems, Compilers, Data Communications and Data Management Systems
Algorithms used with these Data Structures are used in several applications which include Image processing, Digital Signal 
Processing, Cryptogarphy and data Compressions.
