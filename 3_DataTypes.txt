Data types defines the different forms of data.
They are required for effecient coding of programs.
The two types of data are Primitive and Composite data types.


Primitive data type includes Boolean, Integer, Characters .
Various operations can be done on these primitive data types. Some of them are AND, OR and NOT on 
Boolean and, arithmetic and comparison operations on integers.
Primitive Data Types are also called as atomic or Irreducible data types.
They are always supported by the compiler system.
These Primitive data types are described in a program by language specific keywords.


Composite data types are complex data types defined using primivite data types.
Some of the examples are Arrays, vectors and strings.
Array is a collection of homogenous data types.
Vectors are mathematical representation of arrays.
String is a combination of characters.

Now these primitive and composite data types are sufficient for solving simple problems.
But the need for advanced data types arised when the new approach of object oriented design 
came into existance.
