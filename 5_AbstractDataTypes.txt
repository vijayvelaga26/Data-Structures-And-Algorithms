It is the combination of the description of data structure and associated operations
performed on it. Referred as ADT.

ADT has following characteristics:

1.Provides a description of data types of all the elements in the data structure.
2.Defines the relationshhip among individual elements
3.It groups together valid operations that can be performed and different parameters that can be passed.
4.It specifies error conditions if any in any particular condition.

For example, an ADT stack can be defined by packing together the following operations
a. push- Inserts an item into the stack
b. pop- Deletes an item from the stack
c. peek()- returns the top element without removing the element
d. size() - returns no. of items currrently stored.

Now, these set of instructions/operations associated with ADT is called Interface.
Elements of ADT can be manipulated only through interfaces.
The operations and data items are hidden from the application.

All built-in primitive data types are infact abstract data types.
It also doesn't  describe whether the data elements are stored in consecutive or disjoint
locations.
The implementation details are hidden in the application.

Advantages of ADT:

a. It is reusable, robust and is based on principles of Object Oriented Programming and Software Engineering.
b. Encaplsulation ensures that the date cannot be corrupted
c. Based on the SE principles on coupling and cohesion.

Coupling: It determines how strongly two different parts of a program are linked together.
And the extent to which changes made in one part affect the other part in the program.
Cohesion: It determines how well-integrated are the components of software.
For an effecient program the coupling has to be low and the cohesion has to be high.

d. An ADT prmomotes weak coupling and maximum cohesion.
